#The relational operators work with tuples and other sequences; Python 
# starts by comparing the first element from each sequence. If they are 
# equal, it goes on to the next elements, and so on, until it finds 
# elements that differ. Subsequent elements are not considered (even 
# ifthey are really big).

# Functions can take a variable number of arguments. A parameter name that 
# begins with * gathers arguments into a tuple. For example, printall takes
# any number of arguments and prints them:

def printall(*args):
    print(args)

printall(1, 13, 123, 123, 'asda', 'heeheehaha')

# The complement of gather is scatter. If you have a sequence of values
# and you want to pass it to a function as multiple arguments, you can 
# use the * operator. For example, divmod takes exactly two arguments; 
# it doesnâ€™t work with a tuple:

t = (7, 3)
